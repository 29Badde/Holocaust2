                    Following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as German chancellor on January 30, 1933, the Nazi state (also referred to as the Third Reich) 
                    quickly became a regime in which citizens had no guaranteed basic rights. The Nazi rise to power brought an end to the Weimar Republic, 
                    the German parliamentary democracy established after World War I.  In 1933, the regime established the first concentration camps, imprisoning 
                    its political opponents, homosexuals, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and others classified as “dangerous.”  Extensive propaganda was used to spread the Nazi Party’s 
                    racist goals and ideals. During the first six years of Hitler’s dictatorship, German Jews felt the effects of more than 400 decrees and regulations that 
                    restricted all aspects of their public and private lives.</p>

                 <p>
                    The Holocaust took place in the broader context of World War II. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Over the next year, 
                    Nazi Germany and its allies conquered much of Europe. German officials confiscated Jewish property, in many places required Jews to 
                    wear identifying armbands, and established ghettos and forced-labor camps. In June 1941, Germany turned on its ally, the Soviet Union. 
                    Often drawing on local civilian and police support, Einsatzgruppen (mobile killing units) followed the German army and carried out mass 
                    shootings as it advanced into Soviet lands. Gas vans also appeared on the eastern front in late fall 1941.</p>

                    In a period marked by intense fighting on both the eastern and western fronts of World War II, Nazi Germany also intensified its pursuit 
                    of the “Final Solution.” These years saw systematic deportations of millions of Jews to increasingly efficient killing centers using poison 
                    gas. By the end of the war in spring 1945, as the Germans and their Axis partners were pushed back on both fronts, Allied troops uncovered 
                    the full extent of crimes committed during the Holocaust.</p>

                <h1>After 1945</h1>
                
                 <p>
                    By May 1945, the Germans and their collaborators had murdered six million European Jews as part of a systematic plan of genocide—the Holocaust. 
                    When Allied troops entered the concentration camps, they discovered piles of corpses, bones, and human ashes—testimony to Nazi mass murder. 
                    Soldiers also found thousands of survivors—Jews and non-Jews—suffering from starvation and disease. For survivors, the prospect of rebuilding their 
                    lives was daunting. With few possibilities for emigration, tens of thousands of homeless Holocaust survivors were housed in displaced persons (DP) camps. 
                    In the following years, many international and domestic courts conducted trials of accused war criminals.</p>
